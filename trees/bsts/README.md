# Binary Search Tree

A binary search tree (BST) is a useful data structure. The defining feature of a
BST is that keys are maintained in an ordered fashion.

A BST can be used for many different tasks, for example, implementing ordered
bags and ordered sets.

The primary attraction of a BST is that many operations have running complexity
of Big-Oh(log n).
